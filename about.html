        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>My name is Sushil. 
            I completed my SEE at Shree Kalika Secondary School. 
            After that, I moved to Kathmandu for further studies and pursued 
            +2 in Computer Science at Bluebird Secondary School. Currently,
             I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications 
             (BCA) at Aryan School of Engineering and Management,
              where I am in my 3rd semester.</p>
       

         

        <p>
            I have a strong passion for coding and 
            love immersing myself in the world of 
            technology and programming.</p>

            <p>I am a dedicated and passionate individual who 
                thrives on solving problems and contributing 
                to the development of innovative solutions. I am eager 
                to learn and grow as a professional, and I am always 
                looking for opportunities to contribute to the community.</p>
